- would you also do the graph for the relationship between RMSE and the prob-ratio.


- Patrick has prepared a new file, with the ranks for just four of the methods which we’ll use in tables in the revise paper. The four methods are SA (used to be NewEPI), Quad, Square, and EPI (previously OldEPI). Would you re-do the figures with just those four for figure 1 (using the new labels) and those four plus simple random sampling (‘Random’) in figure 2.

**NOTE: changed NewEPI to SA in spreadsheet (by search & replace)**

I think it makes sense to omit the ‘vanilla’ populations, which have been relabelled ‘non-varying’ so anyone interested who wants to see them can comprehend more easily. They’ve been omitted from the tables of ranks, though the results for them are in the file. So please leave them out from the graphs.

**done**

So Fig 1 will need to use the new table of ‘Means of ratios of Sqrts.’ I only just noticed but I think you used the ‘Means of Ratios’ in the figure 1 you did before. I.e., it seems you used the Mean MSEs, not the mean RMSEs. That needs to be changed. Also, relabel NewEPI as ‘SA’ (for ‘small areas’) and OldEPI as simply ‘EPI’.

For Fig 2, again please use just the 50 populations that vary. Limit to the four methods + Random, and again relabel NewEPI as SA and OldEPI as EPI. Would you also check that you used the RMSEs not the MSEs?
